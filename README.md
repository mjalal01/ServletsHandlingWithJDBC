# ServletsHandlingWithJDBC
Handling Servlets and JDBC.
This is some kind of project for handling:
1.Jdbc(Connection pool).
  1)Used Oracle for database
  2) For Connection pool Bundle
2. Servlets(With annotations).
  1)Validating user
  2)Existence of the user in database

So i think that is enough to mention.
